# TREES
A tree is a hierachial data structure made up of finite set of elements called nodes.A tree has a root Node and child nodes.
An edge is a connection from a root to its children.
A path is a sequence of nodes in a tree.
Length of a tree is the distance from the root to the last node.
Depth of a node M is the path from the root to the node M.Root depth=0.
A leaf node is any node with two empty children,and an inetrnal node is any node that has atleast one non empty child.
Traversal is a way of visiting trees in a specific order.
Inorder(Visit left,then node,then right)
Preorder(Visit node,then left,then right)
Postorder(Visit left,then right,then node)

# BINARY SEARCH TREE
A Binary tree is a tree with utmost two children in each node,referred to as the left and right children.
A BST is a binary tree data structure with the following properties
    1.The left subtree of the node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    2.The right subtree of the node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    3.Both the left and the right subtrees must also be binary trees.
    4.There are no duplicate nodes.
TC is O(log n)
